        <h2>I write the best placeholder text. That I can tell you.</h2>
        <p>I know words. I have the best words.</p>

          I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but
          I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be
          China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some
          wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? You know,
          it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young,
          and beautiful, piece of text. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words,
          perhaps I’d be dating it. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero
          because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. An
          'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that
          Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.
        </p>

          I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but
          I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be
          China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some
          wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? That other
          text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. I know words. I have the best words.
          This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be
          met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. My text is long
          and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other
          parts of my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly
          ipsum is one of them. I will write some great placeholder text – and
          nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll
          write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on
          your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that
          text. Mark my words. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you
          imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! The other thing with
          Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations
          before he starts leaking to the press! All of the words in Lorem Ipsum
          have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be
          expected. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take
          out its family. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder
          text.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to
          do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. Despite the
          constant negative ipsum covfefe.
